# Waterloom

Waterloom is a tiny offline-friendly app that turns everyday photos into dreamy watercolor paintings. The interface runs locally using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and relies on OpenCV's stylization filters plus a touch of edge inking for a hand-painted finish.

## Features

- 🌄 Upload any PNG or JPEG and instantly preview the watercolor result side-by-side.
- 🎚️ Adjust brush smoothness, color fidelity, and ink outlines to match your style.
- 💾 Download the finished artwork as a high-quality PNG, all without leaving your machine.

## Getting started

1. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. **Install the dependencies.**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the app locally.**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Visit the local URL that Streamlit prints (usually <http://localhost:8501>) and start transforming your images.

The app disables Streamlit telemetry so it can be used completely offline once the dependencies are installed.

## How it works

- Uploaded images are processed with OpenCV's `cv2.stylization`, which produces watercolor-like diffusion of colors.
- Adaptive thresholding generates subtle ink-like edges that are blended back into the painting for a handcrafted feel.
- Streamlit caches results for repeated adjustments, keeping experimentation snappy.

Enjoy turning your photographs into luminous watercolor artworks! 🎨
